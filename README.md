# Star Wars RPG Game

## A Star Wars themed combat game.

*I chose a battle of Hoth theme for the overall look and feel of the game, using vehicles instead of individual characters. This allowed me to play with different design metaphors like an aircraft hanger and the landscape in which they are fighting. I also wanted to mix the bleak white-out feel of Hoth with some retro LED typography involving some CSS tricks.*

**Things I'd like to add to this project:**
